# critic-web
This is a webapp to enable digital textual criticism.

# TODOs
## How do we display global errors?

## Other Blocks (copy the list from ATG)
for each:
- implement behaviour
- implement view
- implement undo/redo if required
### Anchors
### Corrections

## Make Break a dropdown instead of a raw string input

## Merge Blocks

## Styling

## Ribbon with the commands for which keycommands exist

## bugs
- behaviour for lacuna and break sometimes does not work correctly (getting wrong index and splitting the field incorrectly)
